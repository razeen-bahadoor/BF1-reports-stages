Evaluation
_________________________________
In this section, we evaluate the performance of  manual (the basline) and grammar  constructed test suites.
We evaluate the performance of each by two measures

1. Time taken ie how much resources in terms of raw man hours does it take to construct the suite
2. Code Coverage


Coverage Metrics
________________________

1. Instruction Coverage: this metric emsaures the % of java bytecode instruction executed

2. Branch Coverage: also known as decision coverage, this metric measured the % of branch (typically if/switch statments) exercised by the test suite. Exceptions are not included 

3. Line coverage (possibly sufficient to use instruction coverage)

Experimental Setup
______________________________________________

approach
blackbox

test data
we chose from a corpus of libs a subset, each of different sizes and complexities
lib stats:
	
Library	#lines 	#methods  #instructions
Strman		358		148		2049
TrieSet	77		16		416
StringWriter	32		13		119

grammars: <insert grammars here>
