how do we handle primitive types
how do we handle when all methods are void?
how do we handle subtypes and other sub constraint
ie Optional<>
subtypes
wildcards
lower and upper bounded wilcards
generics
variable args (var args are just arrays so arrays can be passed down)
non primitive types
 ie arrays, object
 autobixing/unbocing
represent  thorws exceptions 

should we always include null for each production?

how do we deal with types that can return the required type nut need a bit more code ie consider Iterator<String> and a method a(String)

how do we know if the function returns null ie trieset.longestprefixof
 
 
how do we tests functions in the lib that have no arguments

what happendas in the case of inheritance do we need to add grammar for inherited mehods
