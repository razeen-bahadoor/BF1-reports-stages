Q1. how do we handle when all/some of the  methods in a lib are void 



Q2. how do we handle primitive types if no production rule exists

q3. How do we construct reference types if no production rule exixts




q4. should we consider visibility contraints ie private, protected etc etc

q5. how deep do we go in the chain and can we control it using parameters

q6. how do we test exceptions


how do we handle subtypes and other sub constraint
arrays
ie Optional<>
subtypes by implmentation or extension
wildcards
lower and upper bounded wilcards
generics
variable args (var args are just arrays so arrays can be passed down)
autobixing/unbocing



 what if the lib has a constructor and a mixture of static/instance methods

should we always include null for each production?

how do we deal with types that can return the required type nut need a bit more code ie consider Iterator<String> and a method a(String)

how do we know if the function returns null ie trieset.longestprefixof
 
 
how do we tests functions in the lib that have no arguments
what happendas in the case of inheritance do we need to add grammar for inherited mehods
