Considerations: 2 cases
	Case 1: primitive types
	Case 2: reference types (String, arrays (primitive typed or reference typed), lists , arraylists, etc)
	



Goal: Given a reference type 
	
	1. construct the object
	2. give the object meaning

	




Ideas: 

how to construct the object:
answer: use the constructor ie write the constructor in ebnf



how to give the object meaning:
sometimes the constructor give meaning to the object ie populates instance vars

if this is not the case we need to use the instance methods to give the obejct meaning 
problem arises when you can chain the instance methods




construct the grammar for the api representing the ref type then merge it with the main grammar



Stack ::= stack

stack::= new stack(),
	sequence of operations
